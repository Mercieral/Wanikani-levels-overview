# Wanikani levels overview

This userscript improves the level overview popup page to show the SRS breakdown of the items within that level. It will also add a green checkbox to levels that are 100% burned, and a gray padlock to levels that are 100% locked. This will also add a "+" to the "Levels" nav bar label to indicate that the script has finished setting up. When hovering over a level, you will see a tooltip with the exact number breakdown, as well as when the next review is for that level.

NOTE: This userscript requires you to install the Wanikani open framework. You can find information on how to install that here https://community.wanikani.com/t/instructions-installing-wanikani-open-framework/28549

This is particularly useful for people working on burning all of the items within levels, as well as it being just interesting to see your progress as you move up the levels.
